# Falcon 9 Landing Prediction (IBM Capstone), Jan 2025

Jan 2025 р.

 
• Led end-to-end analysis of Falcon 9 launch data, using Python, SQL, and machine learning (LogReg, KNN) to predict rocket landings with 94% accuracy.  
• Managed the full pipeline: data collection (API/web scraping), cleaning, EDA, and model development.   
• This hands-on project solidified my transition to data analytics, sharpening my skills in Python, SQL, and predictive modeling.
